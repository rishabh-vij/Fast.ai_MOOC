## Language model and sentiment analysis

**In this section we look at how we can build a language model first which understands the structures of english language and use it as a pretrained model(Transfer learning) to train a sentiment classification model.**

**P.S: As I was building this model in colab, after 4-5 hours of training my runtime disconnected so sadly the notebook is incomplete**
